**Converting Django Model to Abstract Model with Related Classes**

In Django, transitioning a model to an abstract class while maintaining related models requires careful planning and execution to prevent data loss and ensure a smooth migration process. This document outlines two methods to achieve this goal, accompanied by examples.

### Method 1: Using Django's Migration System

1. **Comment Out Related Model Definitions:**
   - Begin by commenting out the related model definitions in your code. This step ensures that Django deletes these models and their associated tables during migration.

   ```python
   # class FictionBook(Book):
   #    genre = models.CharField(max_length=100)

   # class NonFictionBook(Book):
   #    topic = models.CharField(max_length=100)
   ```

2. **Run Migrations to Remove Models:**
   - Execute Django's migration commands to remove the commented-out models and their tables from the database.

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **Set `abstract=True` in Base Class:**
   - Update the base class (e.g., `Book`) to become an abstract class by setting `abstract = True` in its Meta class.

   ```python
   class Book(models.Model):
       title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
       author = models.CharField(max_length=100)

       class Meta:
           abstract = True
   ```

4. **Run Migrations to Delete Base Class Table:**
   - Execute migrations again to delete the base class table, now that it's an abstract class.

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Uncomment Related Model Definitions:**
   - Uncomment the related model definitions.

6. **Run Migrations to Create Tables for Related Models:**
   - Execute migrations to create new tables for the related models with all fields inherited from the base class.

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

### Method 2: Manual Migration

1. **Create Abstract Model:**
   - Define an abstract model with the desired fields and attributes.

2. **Write Migration Manually:**
   - Craft a migration file that removes fields from the model to be inherited and marks it for deletion.

3. **Run the Migration:**
   - Execute the manual migration to remove the model and its associated table.

4. **Inherit from the Abstract Model:**
   - Inherit related models from the newly created abstract model.

5. **Run `makemigrations` and `migrate`:**
   - Generate and apply migrations to reflect the changes in the database schema.

### Examples:

#### Example 1: Book, FictionBook, and NonFictionBook Models

- This example showcases converting the `Book` model to an abstract class while preserving related models `FictionBook` and `NonFictionBook`.

#### Example 2: Animal, Dog, and Cat Models

- This example demonstrates converting the `Animal` model to an abstract class while maintaining related models `Dog` and `Cat`.

### Notes:

- Ensure proper data backup or migration strategy to handle potential data loss during the migration process.
- Choose the method based on your application's requirements and complexity.
- Review and update all references to the models after migration to ensure the application functions correctly.

By following these steps and examples, you can effectively convert Django models to abstract classes while retaining related models and data integrity in your application.
